<p class="intro">A little about myself and how I got to where I am today!</p>

<p>My family moved to Canada from Poland in 1994 and this is where I was exposed to my first true passion, hockey. I still remember the first time I saw Pavel Bure from the Vancouver Canucks score a hat-trick against the Toronto Maple Leafs and from this time on I was on a mission to become a hockey player. Having played at the Canada Winter Games for Team BC gave me the opportunity to be recruited to the University of Toronto to play on the women's hockey team. Here is where I began my undergraduate research in Kinesiology (previously name Bachelor of Physical Education and Health, BPHE). In my second year I sustained my first concussion, which included a series of symptom like light-headedness, constant headaches, sensitivity to light, dizziness and extremely emotional (my mom makes sure I remember how moody and grouchy I was). As with every athlete you return to play as soon as possible and lie about your symptoms. But when I returned on the ice I realized that I did not feel the same. It was as if I couldn't think fast enough, and this is where I realized I wanted to know more.</p>

Oh and she got to be my guinea pig for the heat thermal camera![/caption]

<p>I became fascinated with the brain, taking neuropsychology courses, reading publications and particularly interested in the research world. As a result (along with two more concussions) I began doing research projects including animal models and quickly shifted into volunteering on human concussion projects. After my undergraduate degree I ventured closer to home to the University of Calgary for my Masters of Science (MSc) in neurosciences under the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey Dunn and Dr. Karen Barlow at the Alberta Children's Hospital. My thesis project was aimed at using a technique called functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate brain activity and communication between brain regions in children who has post-concussion symptoms. Although I loved being close to home and enjoyed the beautiful mountains and blue skies (no joke, -30 and sunny all winter long) I decided to move back to Toronto to pursue my PhD. (PS still not a Leafs Fan..)</p>

One year for Toronto and one for Calgary.[/caption]

<p>Currently I am pursuing my PhD in the Concussion Centre at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehab Hospital. My research project is focused on using different neuroimaging techniques to understand how concussions effect the youth brain. I hope that this knowledge will help give insight to stronger rehabilitation approaches to get kids back on the ice when they are fully recovered. At the Concussion Centre, Dr. Nick Reed and Jason Carmichael, the co-directors, are truly innovative in the approach they bring to science. Not only does the Concussion Centre conduct research, but we also provide large outreach initiatives to help educate kids and their families about concussions. This approach has really shown me the importance of sharing knowledge, creating discussions with others and how little is being doing to create this gap between research and the community. Along with Stephanie, my inspiration for this blog is to open a dialogue and learn from each other. Please feel free to contact us and start a conversation.</p>
