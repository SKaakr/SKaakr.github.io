<p>I started taking piano lessons at the age of 4; I was so small that I had to use a step stool to keep my feet from dangling in mid-air. As I grew up, music became and remained a huge part of my identity. But though I became quite good at playing the piano – I have an Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music diploma in piano performance – I never once considered making it my career. Instead, driven by my other major interests in science and technology, I set my sights on becoming an engineer.</p>

<p>I am not sure what I expected when I began my undergraduate program in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering at McMaster University, but research in music science would not have come to mind. That all changed when someone shared with me a news article about the McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind, a multidisciplinary site for research in music. Intrigued by the possibility of revisiting my music interests through research, I contacted the director, Dr. Laurel Trainor, and began volunteering as a research assistant in her lab. I also spent a summer working with Dr. Elaine Biddiss at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, where I developed and evaluated an anxiety monitor that lets caregivers "hear" anxiety in children with profound disabilities. This technology converts electrophysiological indicators of anxiety to musical sounds. In my final year, I did an engineering thesis project supervised by Dr. Trainor, Dr. Takako Fujioka (now at Stanford University), and Dr. Hubert de Bruin. This research allowed me to apply the biomedical engineering topics that I had come to know and enjoy (signal processing and electrophysiology) towards exploring uncharted territory in the science of music. By the time I earned my Bachelor’s degree, I knew that I wanted to continue in research.</p>

<p>My next step was to pursue a Master’s degree with Dr. Ian Bruce, core member of the McMaster Institute for Music and the Mind and director of the Auditory Engineering Lab. There, I used computer models of the auditory midbrain and brainstem to address questions about improving hearing aid algorithms. This was different, exciting, and challenging all at once. With my Master’s complete, I set out in search of my next big challenge. My undergraduate thesis had introduced me to the fascinating idea that movement and music are closely linked, and that this relationship could perhaps be used for motor rehabilitation. For my doctoral research, I decided to find out how this could be applied to kids rehabilitation.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing my PhD in Biomedical Engineering with Dr. Elaine Biddiss (PEARL Lab, Bloorview Research Institute) and Dr. Joyce Chen (PULSE Lab, Sunnybrook Research Institute). I develop and evaluate technologies to deliver music-based rehabilitation approaches in home environments and through play. Our priority is to develop evidence-based technologies and music-supported therapy strategies that have a large reach, so that many children and families will be able to benefit from our research. Like Karolina, I believe that the more we share what we do, the more we can generate discussion and learn from each other. I would not have started on my research path if someone hadn’t shared a news piece about research that fascinated me, and I hope that Karolina and I can do the same for others who visit this site.</p>
